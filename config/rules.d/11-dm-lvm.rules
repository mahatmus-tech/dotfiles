# Udev rules for LVM.
#
# These rules create symlinks for LVM logical volumes in
# /dev/VG directory (VG is an actual VG name). Some udev
# environment variables are set (they can be used in later
# rules as well):
#   DM_LV_NAME - logical volume name
#   DM_VG_NAME - volume group name
#   DM_LV_LAYER - logical volume layer (blank if not set)

# "add" event is processed on coldplug only!

# DM_SUBSYSTEM_UDEV_FLAG0 is the 'NOSCAN' flag for LVM subsystem.
# This flag is used to temporarily disable selected rules to prevent any
# processing or scanning done on the LVM volume before LVM has any chance
# to zero any stale metadata found within the LV data area. Such stale
# metadata could cause false claim of the LV device, keeping it open etc.
#
# If the NOSCAN flag is present, set DM_UDEV_DISABLE_OTHER_RULES_FLAG
# so those selected rules are surely skipped.
# We don't need to save and restore the previous of DM_UDEV_DISABLE_OTHER_RULES_FLAG,
# that's taken care of in 10-dm.rules.
